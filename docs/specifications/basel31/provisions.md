## Overview

Basel 3.1 modifies the provision and expected loss (EL) framework primarily through the
**reduction of F-IRB supervisory LGD** from 45% to 40% for non-FSE senior unsecured exposures.
This change flows through to the EL calculation, reducing expected loss estimates and
consequently affecting the EL shortfall/excess comparison.

### Key Changes from CRR

| Feature | CRR | Basel 3.1 | Reference |
|---------|-----|-----------|-----------|
| F-IRB senior LGD (non-FSE) | 45% | 40% | Art. 161(1)(aa) |
| F-IRB senior LGD (FSE) | 45% | 45% | Art. 161(1)(a) |
| 1.06 scaling factor | Applied | Removed | Art. 153(1) |
| EL monotonicity (A-IRB PMA) | Not required | Required (Art. 158(6A)) | Art. 158(6A) |
| EL shortfall treatment | Full CET1 deduction | Full CET1 deduction (unchanged) | Art. 36(1)(d) |
| EL excess T2 cap | 0.6% of IRB RWA | Unchanged (0.6%) | Art. 62(d) |
| SA provision deduction | Art. 111(1)(a)–(b) | Unchanged | Art. 111(1)(a)–(b) |

---

## SA Provision Treatment (Unchanged)

For SA exposures, provisions are deducted from the exposure value before risk weighting:

```
EAD_net = EAD_gross - specific_provisions - other_provisions_allocated
```

This is the drawn-first deduction approach per Art. 111(1)(a)–(b):

1. Specific credit risk adjustments reduce the exposure value
2. General credit risk adjustments may be included in Tier 2 capital

No changes from CRR for the SA provision mechanism.

---

## IRB Expected Loss Calculation

### F-IRB Expected Loss

```
EL = PD x LGD x EAD
```

Where LGD is the supervisory LGD from the [F-IRB Specification](firb-calculation.md):

| Collateral Type | CRR LGD | Basel 3.1 LGD | Reference |
|----------------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Senior unsecured (non-FSE) | 45% | **40%** | Art. 161(1)(aa) |
| Senior unsecured (FSE) | 45% | **45%** | Art. 161(1)(a) |
| Subordinated | 75% | 75% | Art. 161(1)(b) |
| Covered bonds | 11.25% | **11.25%** | Art. 161(1)(d) → Art. 161(1B) |

The reduction from 45% to 40% for non-FSE senior exposures directly reduces F-IRB expected
loss by approximately 11% ((45−40)/45 ≈ 11.1%), leading to:

- Lower EL shortfall (or higher EL excess)
- More capital available as Tier 2 credit
- Structural reduction in the capital penalty for under-provisioned portfolios

### A-IRB Expected Loss

A-IRB uses the firm's own LGD estimates, subject to LGD floors (see [A-IRB Specification](airb-calculation.md)):

```
EL = PD x LGD_floored x EAD
```

### Art. 158(6A) — EL Monotonicity

**Basel 3.1 addition.** When post-model adjustments (PMA) are applied to A-IRB exposures:

```
EL_adjusted >= EL_unadjusted
```

PMA can increase RWA and EL but must **never decrease EL** below the pre-adjustment level.
This ensures that conservative overlays do not inadvertently reduce expected loss estimates.

!!! note "Implementation"
    EL monotonicity is enforced in the A-IRB calculator after PMA application.

## EL Shortfall / Excess Comparison (Art. 159)

The comparison of total expected loss against total provisions determines the capital impact:

### EL Excess (Provisions > EL)

When total provisions exceed total expected loss:

```
el_excess     = total_provisions - total_el
t2_credit_cap = 0.006 × IRB_credit_risk_RWA
t2_credit     = min(el_excess, t2_credit_cap)
```

The excess (up to the cap) is added to Tier 2 capital per Art. 62(d). See
[Art. 62(d) — T2 Cap on EL Excess](#art-62d-t2-cap-on-el-excess) below for
the verbatim cap text and a worked example.

### EL Shortfall (EL > Provisions)

When total expected loss exceeds total provisions:

```
el_shortfall   = total_el - total_provisions
cet1_deduction = el_shortfall      (full amount)
```

!!! note "Full CET1 Deduction"
    Art. 36(1)(d) requires the **full** EL shortfall to be deducted from CET1. This is
    **unchanged from CRR** — the 50/50 CET1/T2 split was a Basel II treatment that was
    superseded by the CRR. Art. 62(d) addresses only EL excess (positive amounts), not
    shortfall. There is no T2 deduction for shortfall under either framework.

!!! success "Code Correct (P1.116)"
    `src/rwa_calc/engine/aggregator/_el_summary.py` line 241: `cet1_deduction =
    effective_shortfall` (full amount). Line 252: `t2_deduction = Decimal("0")`.
    Previously this code computed a 50/50 split — that was a Basel II-era error,
    corrected under P1.116.

### Art. 159 Component Definitions

The Art. 159 comparison uses four labelled amounts (A, B, C, D):

| Label | Definition | Source |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **A** | EL amounts for **non-defaulted** exposures | PD x LGD x EAD (Art. 158) |
| **B** | Provisions for **non-defaulted** exposures | General CRAs + specific CRAs + AVA (Art. 34) + other own funds reductions |
| **C** | EL amounts for **defaulted** exposures | BEEL for A-IRB (Art. 158(5)); PD x LGD for F-IRB |
| **D** | Specific CRAs for **defaulted** exposures | Specific credit risk adjustments |

!!! info "GCRA vs SCRA classification"
    The general/specific CRA split that determines which amounts go into Pool B (general +
    non-defaulted specific), Pool D (defaulted specific only), and the `SA_T2` / `GCRA`
    terms of OF-ADJ is set by **Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 183/2014** and
    Art. 110. See the
    [Output Floor spec — GCRA Qualifying Criteria](output-floor.md#general-credit-risk-adjustments-gcra-qualifying-criteria)
    for the verbatim definitions, IFRS 9 Stage 1/2/3 mapping, mixed-approach allocation
    (Art. 110(3)), and double-count avoidance rules.

!!! warning "Previous Spec Error Corrected (P4.38)"
    This table previously labelled Pool A as "non-defaulted EL" and Pool B as
    "defaulted provisions". The regulation uses A/B for non-defaulted (EL vs provisions)
    and C/D for defaulted (EL vs specific CRAs). The labels are now corrected to match
    the Art. 159 text.

### Art. 159(3) — Two-Branch Rule

The Art. 159 EL-vs-provisions test has **two distinct branches** depending on
whether the non-defaulted (A vs B) and defaulted (D vs C) pools are aligned in
sign.

```
Branch 1 — split branch (A > B AND D > C, simultaneously):
    negative amount = B − A    (non-defaulted shortfall)
    positive amount = D − C    (defaulted excess)

Branch 2 — combined branch (all other cases):
    if (A + C) > (B + D):
        negative amount = (B + D) − (A + C)
    if (B + D) > (A + C):
        positive amount = (B + D) − (A + C)
```

The split branch prevents specific CRAs on defaulted exposures from offsetting
expected loss amounts on other (non-defaulted) exposures.

!!! quote "PRA PS1/26 Art. 159(3) — verbatim (Credit Risk: IRB Approach (CRR) Part Article 159(3); ps126app1.pdf p. 109)"
    "Where 'A' > 'B' and 'D' > 'C', an institution shall, in order to compare
    expected loss amounts with credit risk adjustments, additional value
    adjustments and other own fund reductions, such that specific credit risk
    adjustments on exposures in default are not used to cover expected loss
    amounts on other exposures:

    (a) calculate the following negative amount: 'B' – 'A'; and

    (b) calculate the following positive amount: 'D' – 'C'.

    In all other cases, an institution shall, in order to compare expected loss
    amounts with credit risk adjustments, additional value adjustments and
    other own fund reductions:

    (c) if ('A' + 'C') > ('B' + 'D'), calculate the following negative amount:
    ('B' + 'D') – ('A' + 'C');

    (d) if ('B' + 'D') > ('A' + 'C'), calculate the following positive amount:
    ('B' + 'D') – ('A' + 'C')."

The **negative amount** is deducted in full from CET1 (Art. 36(1)(d)). The
**positive amount** is admitted to T2 (Art. 62(d)), subject to the cap
formalised below.

### Art. 62(d) — T2 Cap on EL Excess

The Art. 159(3) positive amount (EL excess) flows into Tier 2 capital under
Art. 62(d) of the Own Funds (CRR) Part of the PRA Rulebook, capped at:

```
T2_credit_cap = 0.006 × IRB_credit_risk_RWA      # 0.6% of IRB credit-risk RWA
T2_credit     = min(EL_excess, T2_credit_cap)
```

!!! info "B31 cap base — still 0.6% of IRB RWA, not 1.25% of S-TREA"
    PS1/26 leaves the Art. 62(d) cap unchanged at **0.6% of IRB credit-risk
    RWA**. The 1.25% S-TREA figure that appears elsewhere in the floor
    machinery is the **GCRA** cap (general credit risk adjustments admitted to
    Tier 2 under Art. 92(2A)) — a different input, with a different base, that
    does **not** apply to the EL-excess T2 credit. PS1/26 App 1 page 13
    defines the OF-ADJ input `IRB T2` as "amounts calculated in accordance
    with point (d) of Own Funds (CRR) Part Article 62", confirming that the
    EL-excess Tier 2 credit continues to be governed by the Art. 62(d) 0.6%
    IRB RWA cap. See the
    [Output Floor spec — T2 Component Caps](output-floor.md#t2-component-caps-art-62c-and-art-62d)
    for the full IRB T2 / SA T2 / GCRA cap table.

#### Worked example — both branches

**Scenario A: combined branch with shortfall (CET1 deduction)**

```
Inputs (£m):
  A = 100   (non-defaulted EL, with Art. 158(6A) PMA increase already applied)
  B =  60   (non-defaulted Pool B: GCRA + non-defaulted SCRA + AVA + other reductions)
  C =  40   (defaulted EL — BEEL × EAD for A-IRB; 1 × LGD × EAD for F-IRB)
  D =  30   (defaulted SCRA)
  IRB credit-risk RWA = 12,500

Branch test: A > B (100 > 60) AND D > C? D = 30, C = 40, so D < C.
  → Split branch does NOT apply. Use combined branch.

(A + C) − (B + D) = 140 − 90 = 50 > 0
  → Negative amount = (B + D) − (A + C) = −50.
  → CET1 deduction (Art. 36(1)(d)) = £50m.
  → No T2 credit. T2 cap not engaged.
```

**Scenario B: combined branch with excess, cap binds**

```
Inputs (£m):
  A =  60
  B = 100
  C =  20
  D =  40
  IRB credit-risk RWA = 8,000

(B + D) − (A + C) = 140 − 80 = 60 > 0
  → Positive amount (EL excess) = £60m.

T2 cap (Art. 62(d)):
  T2_credit_cap = 0.006 × £8,000m = £48m
  T2_credit     = min(£60m, £48m) = £48m   (cap binds — £12m of excess unrecognised)
```

**Scenario C: split branch (Art. 159(3)(a)/(b))**

```
Inputs (£m):
  A = 100   (non-defaulted EL)
  B =  60   (non-defaulted Pool B)
  C =  20   (defaulted EL)
  D =  50   (defaulted SCRA)
  IRB credit-risk RWA = 10,000

Branch test: A > B (100 > 60) AND D > C (50 > 20)? Yes — split branch applies.

Negative amount (a) = B − A = −40   (non-defaulted shortfall £40m)
Positive amount (b) = D − C =  30   (defaulted excess £30m)

Capital impact:
  CET1 deduction (Art. 36(1)(d)) = £40m   (full non-defaulted shortfall)
  T2 cap (Art. 62(d)) = 0.006 × £10,000m = £60m
  T2 credit          = min(£30m, £60m)   = £30m  (cap not binding)

Note: Cross-pool netting is precisely what Art. 159(3) split branch prohibits
— both the full £40m CET1 deduction and the £30m (capped) T2 credit flow
through. Under combined-branch netting the institution would have shown a
net £10m excess; the split branch instead recognises both legs separately.
```

!!! note "Framework delta — CRR vs Basel 3.1"
    The Art. 159(3) two-branch rule and the Art. 62(d) 0.6% IRB RWA cap are
    **identical** under CRR and Basel 3.1 — the substantive text in PS1/26
    Credit Risk: IRB Approach (CRR) Part Art. 159 mirrors UK CRR Art. 159 (as
    substituted by Reg (EU) 2019/630), and the Own Funds (CRR) Part Art. 62(d)
    text is unchanged. **The Basel 3.1 addition is the OF-ADJ linkage**: the
    capped `IRB T2` value flows into the output floor adjustment formula
    `OF-ADJ = 12.5 × (IRB_T2 − IRB_CET1 − GCRA + SA_T2)` (Art. 92(2A)), where
    a separate GCRA cap of 1.25% of S-TREA is applied **inside** the engine
    on the GCRA term. The IRB T2 input itself is post-Art. 62(d) cap and is
    supplied by the firm. Under CRR there is no output floor and therefore no
    OF-ADJ — the Art. 62(d) cap stands alone. See
    [Output Floor — T2 Component Caps](output-floor.md#t2-component-caps-art-62c-and-art-62d)
    for the full three-cap interaction table and a worked OF-ADJ example.

### Art. 159(2) — Exclusions from Provisions (B and D)

The following amounts are **excluded** from the provisions side (B and D):

- Defaulted balance sheet discounts (Art. 166A(2))
- Provisions relating to securitised exposures
- Portions covered by CRM risk-weight substitution

### BEEL Exception (Pool C — Art. 158(5))

For **A-IRB defaulted exposures**, Pool C of the Art. 159 comparison uses the
institution's own **BEEL** (Best Estimate of Expected Loss), not `PD x LGD`. The
defaulted EL amount feeding the provisions-vs-EL shortfall/excess test is therefore:

```
Pool C (A-IRB defaulted) = Σ (BEEL_i × EAD_i)
Pool C (F-IRB defaulted) = Σ (1 × LGD_i × EAD_i)   # standard Art. 158(5) formula, PD = 1
```

!!! quote "PRA PS1/26 Art. 158(5) verbatim (ps126app1.pdf p. 107)"
    "[E]xcept for defaulted exposures (PD = 1) where the institution uses the Advanced
    IRB Approach, EL shall be BEEL."

**BEEL is an Art. 158(5) / Art. 181(1)(h)(ii) parameter**, defined in the PRA Rulebook
(Credit Risk: IRB Approach (CRR) Part, Rule 1.3) as *"an institution's best estimate of
expected loss for a defaulted exposure as referred to in point (h)(ii) of Article
181(1)"*. The estimation standards (downturn conditions, unexpected additional
loss during the recovery period, governance and back-testing) are set out in
Art. 181(1)(h)(ii). Under pre-revocation CRR the same parameter was called **`ELBE`**;
PS1/26 renames it to `BEEL` with no substantive change.

**Scope — A-IRB only.** The BEEL substitution operates solely on the Pool C EL
**amount**. F-IRB defaulted exposures use `1 × LGD` (supervisory) for Pool C, since
they do not benefit from own-LGD estimation permissions. The distinct A-IRB
**capital formula** `K = max(0, LGD − BEEL)` (Art. 154(1)(i)) lives in the
defaulted-exposures spec, not here — see
[Defaulted Exposures — BEEL](defaulted-exposures.md#beel-best-estimate-of-expected-loss-art-1585-art-1811hii).

**Interaction with Art. 158(6A).** The BEEL-based Pool C total is **increased** by any
post-model adjustments recognised under Art. 146(3)(c) before entering the Art. 159
test (see [Art. 158(6A) — EL Monotonicity](#art-1586a-el-monotonicity) above).

!!! info "Sovereign/central-bank carve-out"
    Under Art. 147A(1)(a), sovereign, central-bank, RGLA, PSE, MDB and
    international-organisation exposures cannot use A-IRB, so BEEL does not arise for
    these classes — any defaulted quasi-sovereign exposure is handled under SA
    (Art. 127) with no Pool C contribution from the IRB side.
